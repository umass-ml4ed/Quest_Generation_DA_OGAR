<Context> it was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face , and they looked at each other in silence . then tears rose in the eyes of the elder , but winking them hastily away , he said : ' brother , it is not needful that i should tell you how poor i am ; you can see that for yourself . i have not come to beg for money , but only to ask if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city , and i will make them watertight , so that my wife and children can live in them , and that will save our rent . for as they are , they profit you nothing . ' and the younger brother listened and pitied him , and gave him the houses that he asked for , and the elder went away happy . for some years things went on as they were , and then the rich brother began to feel lonely , and thought to himself that he was getting older , and it was time for him to be married . the wife he chose was very wealthy , but she was also very greedy , and however much she had , she always wanted more . she was , besides , one of those unfortunate people who invariably fancy that the possessions of other people must be better than their own . many a time her poor husband regretted the day that he had first seen her , and often her meanness and shabby ways put him to shame . but he had not the courage to rule her , and she only got worse and worse . after she had been married a few months the bride wanted to go into the city and buy herself some new dresses . she had never been there before , and when she had finished her shopping , she thought she would pay a visit to her unknown sister - in - law , and rest for a bit . the house she was seeking was in a broad street , and ought to have been very magnificent , but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door of rough wood , while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing . the dwelling on each side were in the same unfinished condition , and water trickled down the walls . most people would have considered it a wretched place , and turned their backs on it as soon as they could , but this lady saw that by spending some money the houses could be made as splendid as they were originally intended to be , and she instantly resolved to get them for herself .

<Context> but bokwewa watched closely every word that fell from her lips , and often forgot , like her , all mortal appetite and care of the body , in conferring with her , and noting what she had to say of spirits and fairies , of stars , and streams that never ceased to flow , and the delight of the happy hunting - grounds , and the groves of the blessed . one day kwasynd had gone out as usual , and bokwewa was sitting in the lodge , on the opposite side to his brother 's wife , when she suddenly exclaimed : " i must leave you , " as a tall young man , whose face was like the sun in its brightness , entered , and taking her by the hand he led her to the door . she made no resistance , but turning as she left the lodge , she cast upon bokwewa a smile of kind regard , and was at once , with her companion , gone from his view . he ran to the door and glanced about . he saw nothing ; but looking far off in the sky , he thought that he could discover , at a great distance , a shining track , and the dim figures of two who were vanishing in heaven . when his brother returned , bokwewa related all to him exactly as it had happened . the face of kwasynd changed , and was dark as the night . for several days he would not taste food . sometimes he would fall to weeping for a long time , and now only it seemed that he remembered how gentle and beautiful had been the ways of her who was lost . at last he said that he would go in search of her .

<Context> and the sister wept over her poor lost brother , and the fawn wept also , and stayed sadly beside her . at last the maiden said , " be comforted , dear fawn , indeed i will never leave you . " then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn 's neck , and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord , which she fastened to him ; and then she led him on , and they went deeper into the forest . and when they had gone a long long way , they came at last to a little house , and the maiden looked inside , and as it was empty she thought , " we might as well live here . " and she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn , and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself , and fresh grass for the fawn , who ate out of her hand with joy , frolicking round her . at night , when the sister was tired , and had said her prayers , she laid her head on the fawn 's back , which served her for a pillow , and softly fell asleep . and if only the brother could have got back his own shape again , it would have been a charming life . so they lived a long while in the wilderness alone . now it happened that the king of that country held a great hunt in the forest . the blowing of the horns , the barking of the dogs , and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood , and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them .
