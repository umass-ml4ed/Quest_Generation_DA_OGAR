<Context> maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads ; and as they followed him , the rush and hum of the people was like the dead beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm . but the good wind gaining strength , soon carried him beyond their pursuit . a little further on he changed himself into a hawk , and flew swiftly off with his trophy , crying , " ka - kak ! ka - kak ! " till it resounded with its shrill tone through the whole country , far and wide . meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of maidwa , placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka - kak cry of the hawk . in a moment maidwa came past with rustling wings , and as he flew by , giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp , his limbs extended and quivered in an agony , the scalp adhered , and maidwa , in his own person , walked into the lodge and sat down , feeling perfectly at home . the magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had been dealt him , that maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his head he had destroyed his life . presently , however , he was pleased to see him show , by the motion of his hands and limbs , that his strength was returning ; and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet . what was the delight of maidwa to behold , instead of a withered old man , far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow , a bright and cheerful youth , who glittered with life as he stood up before him .

<Context> they were real wampum , white and blue , shining and beautiful ; and the young man , placing them in his bosom , set off ; but as he did not seem quite steady in his belief of the strange woman 's story , the dog spirit - iron , taking his arm , kept close by his side , and gave him many words of encouragement as they went along . they entered the lodge together ; and the old toad - woman saw , from something in the dog 's eye , that trouble was coming . " mother , " said the young man , placing his hand to his head , and leaning heavily upon spirit - iron , as if a sudden faintness had come upon him , " why am i so different in looks from the rest of your children ? " " oh , " she answered , " it was a very bright , clear blue sky when you were born ; that is the reason . " he seemed to be so very ill that the toad - woman at length asked what she could do for him . he said nothing could do him good but the sight of his cradle . she ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle ; but he said : " that is not my cradle . " she went and got another of her own children 's cradles , of which there were four ; but he turned his head , and said : " that is not mine ; i am as sick as ever . " when she had shown the four , and they had been all rejected , she at last produced the real cradle . the young man saw that it was of the same stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom . he could even see the marks of the teeth of spirit - iron left upon the edges , where he had taken hold , striving to hold it back . he had no doubt , now , which was his mother . to get free of the old toad - woman , it was necessary that the young man should kill a fat bear ; and , being directed by spirit - iron , who was very wise in such a matter , he secured the fattest in all that country ; and having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches , he perched the carcass in the top , with its head to the east and its tail due west . returning to the lodge , he informed the old toad - woman that the fat bear was ready for her , but that she would have to go very far , even to the end of the earth , to get it . she answered : " it is not so far but that i can get it ; " for of all things in the world , a fat bear was the delight of the old toad - woman .

<Context> and , as had happened twice before , the trout was there . " troutie , troutie , " she whispered , " am not i the most beautiful woman in the world ? " " by my truth , you are not , " answered the trout , as he had answered on the two previous occasions . " and who do you say is the most beautiful woman now ?

<Context> the washerwoman , who was old and ugly , with a sly and evil face , said that she might -- on one condition -- and that was that she should try to wash a white mantle that the black knight of norroway had brought to her to wash , as he had got it stained in a deadly fight . " yestreen i spent the lee - long day washing it , " went on the old dame , " and i might as well have let it lie on the table . for at night , when i took it out of the wash - tub , the stains were there as dark as ever . peradventure , maiden , if thou wouldst try thy hand upon it thou mightest be more successful . for i am loth to disappoint the black knight of norroway , who is an exceeding great and powerful prince . " " is he in any way connected with the black bull of norroway ? " asked the princess ; for at the name her heart had leaped for joy , for it seemed that mayhap she was going to find once more him whom she had lost . the old woman looked at her suspiciously . " the two are one , " she answered ; " for the black knight chanced to have a spell thrown over him , which turned him into a black bull , and which could not be lifted until he had fought with , and overcome , a mighty spirit of evil that lived in a dark glen . he fought with the spirit , and overcame it and once more regained his true form ; but it is said that his mind is somewhat clouded at times , for he speaketh ever of a maiden whom he would fain have wedded , and whom he hath lost . though who , or what she was , no living person kens . but this story can have no interest to a stranger like thee , " she added slowly , as if she were sorry for having said so much . " i have no more time to waste in talking . but if thou wilt try and wash the mantle , thou art welcome to a night 's lodging ; and if not , i must ask thee to go on thy way . " needless to say , the princess said that she would try to wash the mantle ; and it seemed as if her fingers had some magic power in them , for as soon as she put it into water the stains vanished , and it became as white and clean as when it was new . of course , the old woman was delighted , but she was very suspicious also , for it appeared to her that there must be some mysterious link between the maiden and the knight , if his mantle became clean so easily when she washed it , when it had remained soiled and stained in spite of all the labour which she and her daughter had bestowed upon it .
