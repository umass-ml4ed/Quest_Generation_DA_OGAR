\" you 'll now come in , \" said she , \" and eat a bit of such humble fare as we can give . finn , even though you and he were enemies , would scorn not to treat you kindly in his own house ; and , indeed , if i did n't do it even in his absence , he would not be pleased with me . \" she accordingly brought him in , and placing half a dozen of the cakes we spoke of before him , together with a can or two of butter , a side of boiled bacon , and a stack of cabbage , she desired him to help himself -- for this , be it known , was long before the invention of potatoes . far rua , who , by the way , was a glutton as well as a hero , put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a huge whack out of it , when both finn and oonagh were stunned with a noise that resembled something between a growl and a yell . \" blood and fury ! \" he shouted out . \" how is this ? here are two of my teeth out ! what kind of bread is this you gave me ? \" \" what 's the matter ? \" said oonagh coolly . \" matter ! \" shouted the other . \" why , here are two of the best teeth in my head gone . \" \" why , \" said she , \" that 's finn 's bread -- the only bread he ever eats when at home ; but , indeed , i forgot to tell you that nobody can eat it but himself and that child in the cradle there . i thought , however , that as you were reported to be rather a stout little fellow of your size you might be able to manage it , and i did not wish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight finn . here 's another cake -- maybe it 's not so hard as that . \" far rua , at the moment , was not only hungry , but ravenous , so he accordingly made a fresh set at the second cake , and immediately another yell was heard twice as loud as the first . \" thunder and giblets ! \" he roared , \" take your bread out of this , or i will not have a tooth in my head ; there 's another pair of them gone . \" \" well , honest man , \" replied oonagh , \" if you 're not able to eat the bread say so quietly , and do n't be awakening the child in the cradle there . there , now , he 's awake upon me ! \" finn now gave a skirl that frightened the giant , as coming from such a youngster as he was represented to be . \" mother , \" said he , \" i 'm hungry -- get me something to eat . \" oonagh went over , and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it -- finn , whose appetite in the meantime was sharpened by what he saw going forward , soon made it disappear . far rua was thunderstruck , and secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss meeting finn , for , as he said to himself , i 'd have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that , which even his son that 's in the cradle can munch before my eyes . \" i 'd like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle , \" said he to oonagh , \" for i can tell you that the infant who can manage that nutriment is no joke to look at or to feed of a scarce summer . \" \" with all the veins of my heart , \" replied oonagh . \" get up , acushla , and show this decent little man something that wo n't be unworthy of your father , finn m'coul . \" finn , who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible , got up , and bringing far rua out , \" are you strong ?

\" and he pointed to it as he spoke . \" with all the pleasure in life , \" says she ; \" only as they 're far back in his head you must put your finger a good way in . \" far rua was surprised to find so powerful a set of grinders in one so young ; but he was still much more so on finding , when he took his hand from finn 's mouth , that he had left the very finger upon which his whole strength depended behind him . he gave one loud groan and fell down at once with terror and weakness . this was all finn wanted , who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy . he instantly started out of the cradle , and in a few minutes the great far rua , that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all his followers , was no more .
