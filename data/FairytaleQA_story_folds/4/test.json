' ' alas ! madam , ' said celandine , with tears in her pretty eyes , ' a sad fate forces me to ask you for shelter . ' ' what ! ' cried the princess , ' do you think i am come to beg of you ? ' ' i do n't know about that , ' answered she ; ' but at any rate you do n't seem to have come to bring me anything . but what is it that you do want ? shelter ? well , that does not cost much ; but after that comes supper , and that i ca n't hear of . oh dear no ! why , at your age one is always ready to eat ; and now you have been walking , and i suppose you are ravenous ? ' ' indeed no , madam , ' answered the poor princess , ' i am too sad to be hungry . ' ' oh , well ! if you will promise to go on being sad , you may stay for the night , ' said the old woman mockingly . there upon she made the princess sit down beside her , and began fingering her silken robe , while she muttered ' lace on top , lace underneath ! this must have cost you a pretty penny ! it would have been better to save enough to feed yourself , and not come begging to those who want all they have for themselves . pray , what may you have paid for these fine clothes ?

' ' oh ! for pity 's sake , do what you please with my clothes , ' cried poor celandine miserably . and the old woman hobbled off with great alacrity , and fetched a little bundle containing a wretched dress , such as the princess had never even seen before , and nimbly skipped round , helping her to put it on instead of her own rich robe , with many exclamations of : ' saints!--what a magnificent lining ! and the width of it ! it will make me four dresses at least . why , child , i wonder you could walk under such a weight , and certainly in my house you would not have had room to turn round .

' ' i would rather die than not know what is in that tureen , ' she burst forth so violently that the husband was quite startled . ' is that it ?
